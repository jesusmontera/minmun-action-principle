# minmun-action-principle
Python script to test minimun action principle comparing S action from parabolic path with random  bezier path. It calculates potential and kinetic from both and animate thier curves showing the action so you can corroborate that action from parabolic path is always smaller that any other path that starts and ends in the same points
